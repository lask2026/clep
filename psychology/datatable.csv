Module 1 History and Approaches and Module 13 Statistics, Structuralism, Wilhelm Wundt, "Founded in 1879, it involves breaking consciousness into basic elements like sensations and feelings using introspection.", "Structuralism is often confused with Functionalism; ensure focus is on 'elements' rather than 'purpose'."
