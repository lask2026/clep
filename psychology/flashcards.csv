front,back,Module,CLEP Trap
Introspection,Research tool used by Structuralists to examine one’s own conscious experience.,Module 1: History,CLEP Trap: Too subjective/unreliable; its failure led to the objective rise of Behaviorism.
Functionalism,School of psych (William James) focused on how mental processes help us adapt/survive.,Module 1: History,"CLEP Trap: If the question mentions ""Evolutionary influence"" or ""Purpose,"" it's Functionalism."
Behaviorism,View that psychology should be an objective science that studies behavior without reference to mental processes.,Module 1: History,"CLEP Trap: Led by Watson/Skinner. They ignored ""thinking"" entirely—only focused on what can be seen."
Humanistic Psychology,Perspective emphasizing human growth potential and self-actualization.,Module 1: History,"CLEP Trap: Key names: Maslow/Rogers. It's the ""Third Force""—rejects both Freud and Behaviorism."
Psychoanalytic,Theory (Freud) that unconscious drives and childhood experiences determine behavior.,Module 1: History,"CLEP Trap: Look for keywords like ""Unconscious,"" ""Repressed,"" or ""Early Childhood."""
Biopsychosocial Approach,"Integrated approach that incorporates biological, psychological, and social-cultural levels of analysis.",Module 1: History,"CLEP Trap: This is the modern ""Gold Standard."" Most current Psychologists use this ""eclectic"" view."
Case Study,Descriptive technique in which one individual or group is studied in depth.,Module 13: Methods,"CLEP Trap: Great for rare phenomena, but you CANNOT generalize findings to the whole population."
Correlational Research,Measure of the extent to which two factors vary together.,Module 13: Methods,"CLEP Trap: Correlation DOES NOT equal causation. It only predicts; it doesn't explain ""why."""
Independent Variable,The factor that is manipulated; the variable whose effect is being studied.,Module 13: Methods,"CLEP Trap: This is the ""cause."" In a drug study, the IV is the drug itself (or the dosage)."
Dependent Variable,The outcome factor; the variable that may change in response to manipulations of the IV.,Module 13: Methods,"CLEP Trap: This is the ""effect."" It's usually a measurement (e.g., test scores, reaction time)."
Standard Deviation,A computed measure of how much scores vary around the mean score.,Module 13: Stats,"CLEP Trap: If scores are all very similar, the SD is low. If they are spread out, the SD is high."
Normal Curve (68-95-99.7),Bell-shaped distribution; 68% of scores fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.,Module 13: Stats,CLEP Trap: Memorize these numbers! 68% is always the answer for 1 standard deviation.

Positive Reinforcement,"Increasing behaviors by presenting positive stimuli (e.g., a treat).",Module 5: Learning,CLEP Trap: Add something good to keep behavior going.
Negative Reinforcement,"Increasing behaviors by stopping or reducing negative stimuli (e.g., stopping an alarm).",Module 5: Learning,HUGE TRAP: This is NOT punishment. It increases behavior by removing something bad.
Variable-Ratio Schedule,Reinforcement schedule that reinforces a response after an unpredictable number of responses.,Module 5: Learning,"CLEP Trap: This is the ""Gambling"" schedule (Slot machines). It is the hardest to extinguish."
