# Educational Psychology

## 1. Behavioral Perspective (11%)
- **Core Premise**
  - Focus on observable behavior only
  - Behavior is shaped by environment (not heredity)
- **Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)**
  - *Learning through Association*
  - **UCS (Unconditioned Stimulus)**: Naturally triggers response (e.g., Food)
  - **UCR (Unconditioned Response)**: Natural reaction (e.g., Salivating)
  - **CS (Conditioned Stimulus)**: Neutral becomes trigger (e.g., Bell)
  - **CR (Conditioned Response)**: Learned reaction (e.g., Salivating at bell)
  - **Key Processes**
    - **Generalization**: Responding to similar stimuli (e.g., Fear of all dogs)
    - **Discrimination**: Responding ONLY to specific stimulus
    - **Extinction**: CR weakens when CS presented without UCS
- **Operant Conditioning (Skinner)**
  - *Learning through Consequences*
  - **Reinforcement (Increases Behavior)**
    - **Positive**: Add pleasant stimulus (Stickers, praise)
    - **Negative**: Remove unpleasant stimulus (No chores, stop buzzer)
  - **Punishment (Decreases Behavior)**
    - **Positive**: Add unpleasant stimulus (Detention)
    - **Negative**: Remove pleasant stimulus (Take phone away)
  - **Schedules of Reinforcement**
    - **Continuous**: Every time (Best for new learning)
    - **Fixed Ratio**: Set number of responses (Piecework)
    - **Variable Ratio**: Unpredictable number (Slot machines) -> *Most resistant to extinction*
    - **Fixed Interval**: Set time period (Weekly quiz) -> *Scalloped pattern*

  - **ZPD**: Gap between "can do alone" and "can't do"
  - **Scaffolding**: Support provided in ZPD (fades over time)
  - **Private Speech**: Self-regulation tool
- **Psychosocial (Erikson)**
  - *Mnemonic: Peg Word System*
  - 1. **Trust vs Mistrust** (Infant) -> *One is a Bun (Rust colored)*
  - 2. **Autonomy vs Shame** (Toddler) -> *Two is a Shoe (Auto in a shoe)*
  - 3. **Initiative vs Guilt** (Preschool) -> *Three is a Tree (Quilt on tree)*
  - 4. **Industry vs Inferiority** (School Age) -> *Four is a Dinosaur (Dusty)*
  - 5. **Identity vs Role Confusion** (Adolescent) -> *Five is Skydive (Dents car)*
  - 6. **Intimacy vs Isolation** (Young Adult) -> *Six is Sticks (Two sticks in love)*
  - 7. **Generativity vs Stagnation** (Middle Age) -> *Seven is Heaven (Generator died)*
  - 8. **Integrity vs Despair** (Old Age) -> *Eight is a Plate (Grits on plate)*
- **Moral (Kohlberg)**
  - **Pre-conventional**: Punishment/Reward (Self-interest)
  - **Conventional**: Law & Order / Social Approval
  - **Post-conventional**: Universal Ethics / Social Contract
