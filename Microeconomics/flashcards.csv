front,back,CLEP Trap
"Scarcity","Condition where limited resources cannot satisfy unlimited wants, forcing choices about what to produce, how, and for whom","Trap: Students confuse scarcity (permanent, everywhere) with a temporary market shortage"
"Opportunity cost","The value of the next best alternative foregone when a choice is made","Trap: Often misinterpreted as the sum of all alternatives given up instead of just the single highest-valued one"
"Marginal analysis","Decision-making by comparing the additional (marginal) benefit of one more unit to the additional (marginal) cost","Trap: Students answer based on total or average values rather than marginal values"
"Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)","Graph showing maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with given resources and technology","Trap: Points inside PPC are not 'unattainable'; they are inefficient or represent unemployment"
"Economic growth on PPC","Shown as an outward shift of the entire PPC due to more resources, better technology, or improved institutions","Trap: Moving along an existing PPC is not growth; it is reallocation of resources"
"Absolute advantage","Ability of a producer to make more of a good with the same inputs than another producer","Trap: Students use absolute advantage to decide specialization; comparative advantage is what matters for trade"
"Comparative advantage","Ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer","Trap: Many pick the producer who can make more units instead of the one with the lower opportunity cost"
"Terms of trade","Rate at which goods are exchanged between countries; beneficial if between each country’s opportunity cost for that good","Trap: Accepting trading ratios outside the opportunity cost range that benefit only one country"
"Law of demand","As price decreases, quantity demanded increases, ceteris paribus, and vice versa","Trap: Confusing a 'change in demand' (shift) with a 'change in quantity demanded' (movement along the curve)"
"Law of supply","As price increases, quantity supplied increases, ceteris paribus, and vice versa","Trap: Thinking 'an increase in supply' refers to movement up the curve caused by higher price rather than an actual rightward shift"
"Demand shifters","Income, tastes, prices of related goods, expectations, and number of buyers shift the entire demand curve","Trap: Treating a price change of the good itself as a demand shifter instead of a movement along the curve"
"Supply shifters","Input prices, technology, taxes and subsidies, expectations, and number of sellers shift the supply curve","Trap: Students misinterpret a movement along supply from a price change as a shift in supply"
"Substitutes","Goods that can replace each other; when the price of one rises, demand for the other rises","Trap: Confusing substitutes with complements, reversing the direction of demand shifts"
"Complements","Goods consumed together; when the price of one rises, demand for the other falls","Trap: Treating complements as substitutes so they predict the opposite demand change"
"Market equilibrium","Price and quantity at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied; no inherent tendency for change","Trap: Students assume equilibrium is 'fair' or 'socially optimal' rather than simply the intersection of S and D"
"Shortage","Quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at a price below equilibrium","Trap: Calling any high price a shortage instead of checking Qd versus Qs at that price"
"Surplus","Quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at a price above equilibrium","Trap: Labeling surpluses as shortages because the price is 'too low' conceptually, instead of referencing Qd and Qs"
"Price ceiling","Legal maximum price; if set below equilibrium, it is binding and creates a shortage","Trap: Mixing up which policy (ceiling or floor) creates shortages versus surpluses"
"Price floor","Legal minimum price; if set above equilibrium, it is binding and creates a surplus","Trap: Thinking minimum wage (a price floor) causes a shortage of labor rather than a surplus (unemployment) if binding"
"Consumer surplus","Area between the demand curve and the price line up to the quantity traded; measures buyer benefit above price paid","Trap: Students compute total revenue instead of the triangular surplus area or misidentify the region on the graph"
"Producer surplus","Area between the price line and the supply curve up to the quantity traded; measures seller benefit above minimum acceptable price","Trap: Confusing producer surplus with profit or using the wrong area under demand instead of above supply"
"Total surplus","Sum of consumer and producer surplus; maximized at competitive equilibrium","Trap: Assuming monopolies or price controls can increase total surplus compared to competition"
"Deadweight loss (DWL)","Loss of total surplus that occurs when quantity traded is less than the efficient competitive equilibrium (or more, in some distortions)","Trap: Students shade the tax rectangle or entire area between supply and demand instead of only the small triangle representing lost trades"
"Price elasticity of demand","Measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price: Ed = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price)","Trap: Reversing the fraction (price over quantity) or forgetting to use percentage changes"
"Elastic vs inelastic demand","Elastic: absolute value of Ed greater than 1; inelastic: absolute value of Ed less than 1; unit elastic: absolute value of Ed equals 1","Trap: Treating 'steeper' visually as always more inelastic without considering actual percent changes"
"Total revenue and elasticity","TR = price * quantity; when demand is elastic, price and total revenue move in opposite directions; when inelastic, they move in the same direction","Trap: Memorizing rules but then applying them backward under exam pressure"
"Income elasticity of demand","Measures responsiveness of demand to changes in income; positive for normal goods, negative for inferior goods","Trap: Calling a good 'normal' or 'inferior' based on price changes instead of income changes"
"Cross-price elasticity of demand","Measures responsiveness of demand for one good to price changes of another; positive for substitutes, negative for complements","Trap: Misreading the sign, so they label complements as substitutes or vice versa"
"Normal vs inferior goods","Normal: demand increases when income rises; inferior: demand decreases when income rises","Trap: Confusing inferior goods with low-quality goods; 'inferior' is about income response, not quality"
"Giffen good","A theoretical inferior good for which demand increases when its price rises because of strong income effect","Trap: Over-applying this rare case to justify upward-sloping demand in normal questions"
"Utility","A measure of satisfaction or happiness from consuming goods and services","Trap: Treating utility as something objectively measurable in dollars instead of a theoretical concept"
"Marginal utility (MU)","The additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good or service","Trap: Using total utility instead of marginal utility in decision rules"
"Law of diminishing marginal utility","As more units of a good are consumed, marginal utility eventually declines","Trap: Students think total utility must fall when marginal utility decreases; total utility can still rise as long as MU remains positive"
"Utility maximization rule","Consumers maximize utility when marginal utility per dollar is equal across all goods and the budget is fully spent","Trap: Setting MU of X equal to MU of Y instead of MUx / Px equal to MUy / Py"
"Budget constraint","A line showing all combinations of goods a consumer can afford given income and prices","Trap: Misinterpreting a pivot as an income change instead of a price change"
"Income effect","Change in quantity demanded caused by a change in consumer purchasing power (real income) from a price change","Trap: Attributing all quantity changes to substitution effect when some are income effect"
"Substitution effect","Change in quantity demanded caused by a good becoming relatively cheaper or more expensive compared to alternatives","Trap: Confusing substitution effect with a shift of the demand curve rather than movement along it"
"Short run vs long run in production","Short run: at least one input is fixed; long run: all inputs are variable","Trap: Defining short run and long run by calendar time instead of fixed versus variable inputs"
"Total product (TP)","Total output produced by a given amount of inputs","Trap: Confusing TP with average or marginal product on tables and graphs"
"Marginal product (MP)","Additional output produced by one more unit of a variable input, holding other inputs fixed","Trap: Using change in input divided by change in output instead of output change divided by input change"
"Law of diminishing marginal returns","As more units of a variable input are added to fixed inputs, marginal product eventually decreases","Trap: Students think returns become negative immediately instead of first rising then diminishing"
"Fixed cost (FC)","Cost that does not vary with output in the short run (for example, rent)","Trap: Treating labor costs as fixed when they are usually variable"
"Variable cost (VC)","Cost that varies with output (for example, wages, materials)","Trap: Including fixed costs like long-term lease payments as variable"
"Total cost (TC)","Sum of fixed and variable costs: TC = FC + VC","Trap: Double-counting costs when moving from FC and VC to TC"
"Average total cost (ATC)","Total cost divided by quantity of output: ATC = TC / Q","Trap: Forgetting that ATC includes both fixed and variable costs, not just variable"
"Average variable cost (AVC)","Variable cost divided by quantity of output: AVC = VC / Q","Trap: Using TC instead of VC in the numerator"
"Average fixed cost (AFC)","Fixed cost divided by quantity of output: AFC = FC / Q","Trap: Expecting AFC to be U-shaped; it continuously declines as output rises"
"Marginal cost (MC)","Change in total cost resulting from producing one more unit: MC = change in TC / change in Q","Trap: Using average cost formulas when a question specifically asks for marginal cost"
"Cost curve relationships","MC intersects both ATC and AVC at their minimum points","Trap: Mislabeling curves so they conclude MC crosses ATC at the wrong quantity"
"Shutdown rule (short run)","A firm should shut down in the short run if price is less than AVC; if price is at least AVC, it should produce even if price is below ATC","Trap: Confusing shutdown point (P < AVC) with break-even point (P = ATC)"
"Economies of scale","Long-run average total cost decreases as output increases due to specialization and spreading fixed costs","Trap: Confusing economies of scale (LR concept) with diminishing marginal returns (SR concept)"
"Diseconomies of scale","Long-run average total cost increases as output increases due to coordination and management problems","Trap: Attributing diseconomies to rising marginal cost in the short run rather than to long-run scale issues"
"Perfect competition characteristics","Many small firms, identical products, free entry and exit, and price-taking behavior","Trap: Thinking a competitive firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve; it faces a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand at market price"
"Profit maximization rule","Any firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC)","Trap: Using 'produce where ATC is minimized' or 'where profit is highest' without checking MR and MC equality"
"Total profit","Profit = total revenue − total cost; total revenue = price * quantity","Trap: Using price minus ATC without multiplying by quantity when calculating total profit"
"Short-run outcomes in perfect competition","If price > ATC, the firm earns economic profit; if ATC > price > AVC, the firm loses money but stays open; if price < AVC, the firm shuts down","Trap: Misapplying shutdown rule by focusing on ATC instead of AVC"
"Long-run equilibrium in perfect competition","Entry and exit drive economic profits to zero; firms produce where price equals minimum ATC and price equals MC","Trap: Thinking zero economic profit means firms are indifferent to staying in the industry; they still cover all opportunity costs"
"Allocative efficiency","Occurs when price equals marginal cost (P = MC), meaning resources go to goods valued most highly by consumers","Trap: Believing any equilibrium is allocatively efficient even when P ≠ MC (such as in monopoly)"
"Productive efficiency","Occurs when production uses the lowest possible cost per unit, at the minimum of ATC","Trap: Assuming monopolies or monopolistic competition are productively efficient in the long run; only perfect competition is"
"Monopoly characteristics","Single seller, unique product, high barriers to entry, and price-making power","Trap: Confusing monopoly with monopolistic competition (which has many firms and product differentiation)"
"Monopoly demand and MR","Monopolist faces the market demand curve; marginal revenue is below demand because to sell more, price must fall on all units","Trap: Drawing MR equal to demand as in perfect competition"
"Monopoly profit-maximizing output","Monopolist produces where MR = MC and charges the price on the demand curve at that quantity","Trap: Students mistakenly set price equal to MC or ATC to find monopoly quantity"
"Deadweight loss from monopoly","Loss of total surplus because monopolist restricts output below competitive level and charges higher price","Trap: Shading the entire area between monopolist and competitive prices instead of just the lost trade triangle"
"Price discrimination","Charging different prices to different consumers for the same product based on willingness to pay, not cost differences","Trap: Confusing legal forms (student discounts) with illegal discrimination; exam focuses on economic idea"
"Perfect price discrimination","Monopolist charges each customer their maximum willingness to pay, capturing all consumer surplus","Trap: Assuming perfect price discrimination increases deadweight loss; it actually eliminates DWL in the simple model"
"Monopolistic competition characteristics","Many firms, differentiated products, relatively easy entry and exit","Trap: Calling it 'a monopoly' because each firm has some market power; it is structurally more like perfect competition long run"
"Long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition","Firms earn zero economic profit; demand curve is tangent to ATC at MR = MC; there is excess capacity","Trap: Thinking they produce at minimum ATC; they operate with excess capacity instead"
"Oligopoly characteristics","Few large firms, significant barriers to entry, possible collusion, and mutual interdependence","Trap: Treating oligopoly like perfect competition or monopoly without recognizing strategic interaction"
"Game theory and payoff matrix","Tool to analyze strategic interactions where each firm's outcome depends on its own choice and rivals’ choices","Trap: Picking outcomes that maximize joint profit without checking if each firm has incentive to deviate (Nash equilibrium condition)"
"Nash equilibrium","Situation where no player can gain by unilaterally changing their strategy, given others’ strategies","Trap: Choosing the outcome with highest combined payoff instead of the one where neither player wants to deviate alone"
"Dominant strategy","A strategy that yields a higher payoff for a player regardless of the opponent’s action","Trap: Thinking every game has a dominant strategy; many do not"
"Kinked demand curve theory","Model suggesting oligopoly firms face a demand curve that is more elastic for price increases than for price cuts, leading to sticky prices","Trap: Over-applying kinked demand model when an exam question is really about collusion or standard oligopoly"
"Cartel","Group of firms acting together to maximize joint profits, often by restricting output and raising price","Trap: Assuming cartels are stable; in theory each member has an incentive to cheat"
"Explicit vs implicit costs","Explicit: direct monetary payments; implicit: opportunity costs of owner's resources used in business","Trap: Calculating economic profit using only explicit costs (accounting profit) and ignoring implicit costs"
"Economic profit vs accounting profit","Accounting profit = total revenue − explicit costs; economic profit = total revenue − (explicit + implicit costs)","Trap: Confusing zero economic profit with zero accounting profit; zero economic profit usually implies positive accounting profit"
"Marginal revenue product (MRP)","Additional revenue a firm earns from employing one more unit of a factor: MRP = MP * MR","Trap: Forgetting that in a perfectly competitive output market MR equals price, so MRP equals MP times price"
"Marginal factor cost (MFC)","Additional cost of employing one more unit of a factor (often equal to wage in competitive labor markets)","Trap: Using average factor cost instead of marginal when applying hiring rule"
"Hiring rule in factor markets","Hire labor until MRP equals MFC (often wage); beyond that, additional workers reduce profit","Trap: Setting MRP equal to wage but then hiring even when MRP < wage in tables"
"Derived demand for labor","Labor demand depends on demand for the output the labor helps produce; it is 'derived' from product market demand","Trap: Treating labor demand as independent of product price or productivity"
"Competitive labor market equilibrium","Wage and employment determined where labor demand (MRP) equals labor supply","Trap: Thinking a single competitive firm can influence market wage by adjusting its own hiring"
"Monopsony","A labor market with a single or dominant buyer of labor that faces an upward-sloping labor supply and has MFC above wage","Trap: Treating monopsony like monopoly in the product market and drawing the wrong curves"
"Union wage setting","Unions can push wages above competitive levels, possibly causing unemployment if binding","Trap: Assuming any wage increase from unions always raises employment"
"Negative externality in production","Situation where a firm’s production imposes external costs (like pollution) on others, causing overproduction relative to the socially optimal level","Trap: Students shift demand instead of supply when the externality is on the cost side"
"Positive externality in consumption","Situation where a consumer’s consumption provides benefits to others (like vaccines), causing underconsumption relative to the socially optimal level","Trap: Moving supply instead of demand; consumption externalities shift demand"
"Socially optimal quantity (externalities)","Quantity where marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost","Trap: Confusing private equilibrium (where MPB = MPC) with social optimum (MSB = MSC)"
"Pigouvian tax","Tax designed to internalize a negative externality by making firms face the full social cost, reducing output to the socially optimal level","Trap: Believing any tax is Pigouvian; it must be targeted to equal marginal external cost"
"Pigouvian subsidy","Subsidy designed to internalize a positive externality by increasing private benefit to match social benefit","Trap: Confusing generic subsidies (like farm price supports) with externality-correcting subsidies"
"Public good","Good that is nonrival and nonexcludable, such as national defense or street lighting","Trap: Students define any government-provided good as a public good, even when it is rival and excludable"
"Free-rider problem","People can benefit from a public good without paying, leading markets to underprovide such goods","Trap: Applying free-rider problem to private goods rather than nonexcludable ones"
"Common resource","Good that is rival but nonexcludable, like open-access fisheries or public grazing land","Trap: Confusing common resources with public goods; common resources can be depleted by overuse"
"Tragedy of the commons","Overuse and depletion of a common resource because individual users ignore the external cost they impose on others","Trap: Attributing the problem to high prices rather than lack of property rights or exclusion"
"Club good","Good that is nonrival but excludable, like a subscription streaming service with low marginal cost of an extra user","Trap: Students lump club goods with public goods or private goods without checking both criteria"
"Welfare effects of price ceilings","Binding ceilings transfer surplus from producers to consumers but create deadweight loss from lost trades","Trap: Ignoring the deadweight loss and thinking ceilings always 'help consumers overall'"
"Welfare effects of price floors","Binding floors transfer surplus from consumers to producers (in some cases) but create deadweight loss and often require government purchases","Trap: Overlooking government budget costs and DWL while focusing only on changed producer surplus"
"Tax incidence and elasticity","The side of the market that is more inelastic bears more of the economic burden of a tax","Trap: Assuming legal incidence (who remits tax) determines who actually bears the burden"
"Subsidies and market outcomes","Subsidies shift supply (or demand) and generally increase quantity traded, but also create deadweight loss and budget cost","Trap: Assuming subsidies always increase total surplus; they increase CS and PS but create DWL from overproduction"
"Short run vs long run in micro markets","Short run: some inputs fixed and number of firms fixed; long run: all inputs variable and firms can enter or exit","Trap: Ignoring entry and exit in long-run questions and treating the situation as static"
"Long-run adjustment in monopolistic competition","Profits attract entry, shifting each firm’s demand left until only normal profit remains","Trap: Thinking entry shifts industry supply, not individual firm demand, in this model"
"Key difference: monopoly vs monopolistic competition","Monopoly has one firm and high barriers; monopolistic competition has many firms and free entry with differentiated products","Trap: Choosing 'monopoly' when a scenario clearly describes many firms and advertising/differentiation"
