front,back,CLEP Trap
"Scarcity","The condition where limited resources cannot satisfy unlimited wants, forcing individuals and societies to make choices about resource allocation","Trap: Students think scarcity means 'shortage'; scarcity exists even in rich economies and is permanent, whereas a shortage is a temporary market condition"
"Opportunity cost","The value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made","Trap: Often confused with 'all alternatives given up'; only the single highest-valued foregone option counts as opportunity cost"
"Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)","A curve showing the maximum combinations of two goods an economy can produce with fixed resources and technology","Trap: Points inside the PPC are not impossible, they are inefficient; points outside are unattainable with current resources"
"Points on, inside, and outside PPC","On the curve: efficient; inside: inefficient/unemployment; outside: unattainable with current resources","Trap: Questions may describe unemployment and ask which PPC location it implies; many mistakenly pick a point on the curve instead of inside"
"Economic growth on PPC","Shown as an outward shift of the PPC, indicating increased productive capacity due to more resources or better technology","Trap: Moving along an existing PPC is not growth, it is a reallocation of resources"
"Absolute advantage","The ability of a producer or country to produce more of a good with the same resources than another producer or country","Trap: Test items ask about who should specialize; specialization is based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage"
"Comparative advantage","The ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer or country","Trap: Many students incorrectly choose the country that can produce the most (absolute advantage) instead of the lowest opportunity cost"
"Terms of trade","The agreed rate at which two goods are exchanged between countries; beneficial if it lies between each country's opportunity cost for that good","Trap: Students forget the 'between opportunity costs' rule and accept trade terms that favor only one country"
"Law of demand","As the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises, ceteris paribus, and vice versa","Trap: Confusing a change in demand (shift) with a change in quantity demanded (movement along the curve)"
"Law of supply","As the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied rises, ceteris paribus, and vice versa","Trap: Students sometimes think 'supply increases' when price rises, but that is a movement along the supply curve, not a shift"
"Demand shifters","Non-price factors that shift demand: income, tastes, prices of related goods, expectations, and number of buyers","Trap: Price of the good itself does not shift the demand curve; only causes movement along the curve"
"Supply shifters","Non-price factors that shift supply: input prices, technology, taxes and subsidies, expectations, and number of sellers","Trap: Students may treat a change in price of the good as a supply shifter instead of a movement along supply"
"Market equilibrium","The price and quantity at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, with no tendency to change","Trap: Confusing equilibrium with the 'fair' or 'desired' price; it is simply where Qd equals Qs"
"Price ceiling","A legal maximum price set below equilibrium that creates a shortage when binding","Trap: Students mix up which control creates a shortage vs surplus; ceilings (if binding) create shortages"
"Price floor","A legal minimum price set above equilibrium that creates a surplus when binding","Trap: Students reverse the effects and say 'price floor causes shortage'; actually it causes surplus if binding"
"Shortage vs surplus","Shortage: Qd > Qs at a price below equilibrium; Surplus: Qs > Qd at a price above equilibrium","Trap: Many mislabel shortages as surpluses and vice versa on graphs"
"Nominal vs real values","Nominal values are measured in current prices; real values are adjusted for changes in the price level","Trap: Students interpret rising nominal GDP as higher real output without considering inflation"
"Expenditure approach to GDP","GDP = C + I + G + (X − M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government purchases, X is exports, and M is imports","Trap: Counting intermediate goods or transfer payments as part of GDP when they should be excluded"
"Real GDP","GDP measured using constant base-year prices to remove the effect of inflation and reflect actual output changes","Trap: Confusing real GDP with nominal GDP or with GDP per capita"
"GDP deflator","A price index that measures the overall price level: GDP deflator = (nominal GDP / real GDP) * 100","Trap: Students mix up CPI and GDP deflator or use CPI formula for deflator questions"
"Price index formula","Price index = (cost of market basket in current year / cost of market basket in base year) * 100","Trap: In inflation problems, students sometimes reverse the numerator and denominator, flipping the index"
"Inflation rate formula","Inflation rate = (price index in current year − price index in previous year) / (price index in previous year) * 100","Trap: Forgetting to divide by the previous year's index or treating the raw difference as the percent change"
"Labor force","The sum of employed and unemployed people who are actively seeking work","Trap: Students mistakenly include discouraged workers who have stopped looking for work in the labor force"
"Unemployment rate","Unemployment rate = (number of unemployed / labor force) * 100","Trap: Using total population instead of labor force in the denominator"
"Types of unemployment","Frictional: between jobs; structural: skills mismatch; cyclical: due to downturns in the business cycle","Trap: Mislabeling all unemployment in recessions as structural when it is cyclical"
"Natural rate of unemployment","The unemployment rate when the economy is at full employment, including only frictional and structural unemployment","Trap: Students think natural unemployment rate is zero; it never eliminates frictional and structural unemployment"
"Business cycle phases","The recurring pattern of expansion, peak, recession, and trough in real GDP over time","Trap: Confusing short-term fluctuations (cycles) with long-run growth trend"
"Aggregate demand (AD)","Total demand for goods and services in an economy at different price levels: AD = C + I + G + (X − M)","Trap: Students confuse aggregate demand with micro-level market demand for a single good"
"AD downward slope reasons","Wealth effect, interest rate effect, and net export effect cause AD to slope downward","Trap: Students try to explain AD slope with substitution effect, which is a micro concept"
"Short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)","The relationship between price level and quantity of output supplied when some input prices are sticky","Trap: Confusing SRAS with LRAS and treating both as vertical"
"Long-run aggregate supply (LRAS)","Vertical at potential output, representing full-employment real GDP when prices and wages are fully flexible","Trap: Students think an increase in price level shifts LRAS, but LRAS shifts only with real factors like technology and resources"
"Recessionary (negative) output gap","When actual real GDP is below potential output; unemployment is above the natural rate","Trap: Some assume any inflation means no recessionary gap; recessionary gap focuses on output relative to potential, not just inflation"
"Inflationary (positive) output gap","When actual real GDP is above potential output; unemployment is below the natural rate","Trap: Students mistake any high price level for an inflationary gap; what matters is output relative to potential"
"MPC and MPS","MPC (marginal propensity to consume) = change in consumption / change in income; MPS (marginal propensity to save) = change in saving / change in income; MPC + MPS = 1","Trap: Forgetting that MPC + MPS must equal 1 and using inconsistent values in multiplier questions"
"Spending multiplier","Multiplier = 1 / (1 − MPC) which equals 1 / MPS","Trap: Students invert the formula incorrectly or plug in total consumption instead of MPC"
"Tax multiplier","Tax multiplier = −MPC / (1 − MPC)","Trap: Forgetting that the tax multiplier is negative and smaller in magnitude than the spending multiplier"
"Crowding out","When increased government borrowing raises interest rates and reduces private investment, partially offsetting expansionary fiscal policy","Trap: Confusing crowding out with 'crowding in' or assuming government spending always fully boosts AD"
"Fiscal policy","Use of government spending and taxation to influence aggregate demand and stabilize the economy","Trap: Students confuse fiscal policy (G and T) with monetary policy (money supply and interest rates)"
"Expansionary fiscal policy","Policy that increases government spending and/or cuts taxes to increase AD and close a recessionary gap","Trap: Thinking tax cuts always increase AD even when they are not spent (MPC matters)"
"Contractionary fiscal policy","Policy that decreases government spending and/or raises taxes to reduce AD and fight inflation","Trap: Students mix up which direction government spending and taxes move under contractionary policy"
"Automatic stabilizers","Budget features like progressive taxes and unemployment benefits that automatically increase spending or cut taxes in recessions without new legislation","Trap: Confusing automatic stabilizers with discretionary fiscal actions that require a vote"
"Monetary policy","The central bank's control of the money supply and interest rates to influence aggregate demand","Trap: Students name changes in government spending or taxation as monetary tools"
"Open market operations","Central bank buying or selling of government bonds to change the money supply","Trap: Reversing effects: buying bonds increases the money supply; selling bonds decreases it"
"Effect of buying bonds","Central bank bond purchases increase bank reserves, increase the money supply, and lower interest rates","Trap: Students often think bond purchases are contractionary because the central bank is 'spending money'"
"Effect of selling bonds","Central bank bond sales reduce bank reserves, decrease the money supply, and raise interest rates","Trap: Confusing selling bonds with expansionary policy; selling bonds is contractionary"
"Required reserve ratio (rr)","The fraction of deposits banks must hold as reserves and not loan out","Trap: Treating reserve ratio changes as trivial; on the exam, rr changes have big effects on money creation"
"Simple money multiplier","Money multiplier = 1 / required reserve ratio","Trap: Using excess reserves instead of rr in the denominator or forgetting to convert rr from percent to decimal"
"Money market","Market where the supply and demand for money determine the nominal interest rate","Trap: Confusing the money market with the loanable funds market, which uses the real interest rate and different curves"
"Loanable funds market","Market for saving and borrowing where the real interest rate balances supply of and demand for loanable funds","Trap: Students use nominal interest rates when the diagram is clearly labeled with real interest"
"Real interest rate","Real interest rate ≈ nominal interest rate − inflation rate","Trap: Students add instead of subtract or forget to adjust for inflation at all"
"Functions of money","Medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value","Trap: Listing 'source of value' or 'measure of wealth' instead of the standard three functions"
"Components of M1","Includes currency in circulation and checkable (demand) deposits; the most liquid forms of money","Trap: Including savings accounts and large time deposits in M1 instead of M2"
"Phillips curve (short run)","Shows an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment in the short run","Trap: Thinking this relationship holds exactly in the long run; it only describes the short-run trade-off"
"Phillips curve (long run)","Vertical at the natural rate of unemployment, showing no trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the long run","Trap: Students draw a downward-sloping long-run Phillips curve or assume policy can permanently lower unemployment with inflation"
"Demand-pull inflation","Inflation caused by increases in aggregate demand, often from expansionary policy or strong spending","Trap: Confusing demand-pull inflation with cost-push inflation from supply shocks"
"Cost-push inflation","Inflation caused by decreases in short-run aggregate supply, often due to rising input costs or negative supply shocks","Trap: Mislabeling cost-push inflation as a demand shift when the correct curve is SRAS"
"Stagflation","Combination of high inflation and high unemployment, usually due to a negative supply shock shifting SRAS left","Trap: Assuming high inflation always goes with low unemployment because of the Phillips curve"
"Balance of payments","Record of all transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world, consisting of the current account and the financial account","Trap: Students think the balance of payments must always equal zero separately for each account, rather than overall"
"Current account","Part of the balance of payments that records trade in goods and services, net income from abroad, and net current transfers","Trap: Including purchases of foreign assets in the current account instead of the financial account"
"Financial account","Part of the balance of payments that records purchases and sales of financial assets and real assets across borders","Trap: Mixing up financial account with current account, especially for bond and stock purchases"
"Exchange rate appreciation","An increase in the value of a currency relative to another, meaning each unit buys more foreign currency","Trap: Students often think appreciation helps exports; it actually tends to reduce exports and increase imports"
"Exchange rate depreciation","A decrease in the value of a currency, meaning each unit buys less foreign currency","Trap: Confusing depreciation with deflation; depreciation is about currency value, not domestic price level"
"Effect of appreciation on net exports","Appreciation makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, tending to reduce net exports","Trap: Students say 'strong currency is always good' and forget it can hurt net exports"
"Effect of depreciation on net exports","Depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, tending to increase net exports","Trap: Thinking depreciation hurts exports because currency is 'weak'; in fact, it helps export competitiveness"
"Open economy interest rate effect","If domestic real interest rates rise relative to foreign rates, capital flows in, the domestic currency appreciates, and net exports fall","Trap: Students think higher interest rates always increase net exports because saving rises"
"Automatic vs discretionary fiscal policy","Automatic stabilizers operate without new laws; discretionary policy requires deliberate legislative action","Trap: Labeling a voted stimulus package as 'automatic' when it is discretionary"
"Short run vs long run in macro","Short run: some prices and wages are sticky; long run: all prices and wages are flexible","Trap: Students apply long-run reasoning (vertical LRAS) to short-run AD-AS questions and vice versa"
"Economic growth vs business cycle expansion","Growth is a long-run upward trend in potential output; expansion is a short-run movement above recent output levels","Trap: Treating any increase in GDP as long-run growth rather than distinguishing trend from cycle"
"Human capital","The skills, knowledge, and health of workers that increase their productivity","Trap: Confusing human capital (intangible) with physical capital like machines and buildings"
"Physical capital","Produced resources such as machinery, tools, and buildings used to make other goods and services","Trap: Calling natural resources or money 'physical capital'; they are different categories"
"Role of technology in growth","Technological progress allows more output from the same inputs, shifting LRAS and PPC outward","Trap: Students think technology only affects AD through investment, ignoring its LRAS impact"
"Government budget deficit","Occurs when government spending exceeds tax revenue in a given period","Trap: Confusing deficit (flow each year) with debt (accumulated past deficits)"
"Crowding out and growth","Persistent deficits may raise interest rates and crowd out private investment, slowing capital accumulation and long-run growth","Trap: Ignoring long-run effects of deficits and treating them as only short-run AD boosts"
"Keynesian vs classical view of self-correction","Keynesians think wages and prices are sticky so self-correction is slow; classical view assumes flexible prices and quick return to full employment","Trap: Assuming the exam will always assume instant self-correction; many questions use the Keynesian short run"
"Real wage","Real wage = nominal wage / price level; measures purchasing power of wages","Trap: Treating nominal and real wages as the same when inflation is present"
"Nominal vs real GDP growth","Nominal GDP growth includes changes in price and output; real GDP growth reflects only changes in output","Trap: Concluding that living standards rose just because nominal GDP increased"
"Multiplier and crowding out together","The actual impact of fiscal policy is the theoretical multiplier effect minus any reduction in investment from crowding out","Trap: Overstating fiscal policy's impact by applying full multiplier without considering interest rate effects"
"Short-run AD-AS shock stories","Positive AD shock: higher real GDP and price level; negative AD shock: lower real GDP and price level; negative SRAS shock: lower real GDP and higher price level","Trap: Misidentifying which curve shifts for demand vs supply shocks"
"Money neutrality in the long run","In the long run, changes in the money supply affect nominal variables (like price level) but not real variables (like real GDP)","Trap: Assuming monetary policy can permanently raise real GDP in the long run"
"Hyperinflation","Extremely high and accelerating inflation, usually caused by rapid growth in the money supply far beyond growth in output","Trap: Students sometimes attribute hyperinflation only to 'greedy firms' instead of monetary causes"
"Costs of unexpected inflation","Unexpected inflation redistributes income between borrowers and lenders and increases uncertainty","Trap: Confusing expected and unexpected inflation; expected inflation is already priced into contracts"
"Foreign exchange market curves","Demand for a currency is from foreigners buying domestic goods and assets; supply of a currency is from residents buying foreign goods and assets","Trap: Reversing which side is demand and which is supply when reading FX graphs"
"Link between loanable funds and FX","Higher domestic real interest rates attract foreign capital, shifting demand for domestic currency right and causing appreciation","Trap: Ignoring the connection between interest rate changes at home and currency movements"
"Sticky wages","Nominal wages that adjust slowly to changes in economic conditions, making SRAS upward sloping","Trap: Students think wages adjust instantly in the short run, eliminating short-run output gaps"
"Okun's law (conceptual)","The idea that when unemployment is above the natural rate, real GDP is below potential; larger unemployment gaps imply larger negative output gaps","Trap: Expecting precise numeric Okun's coefficient; CLEP usually tests only the qualitative relationship"
"Menu and shoe-leather costs","Menu costs: costs of changing prices; shoe-leather costs: costs of more frequent transactions due to inflation","Trap: Mixing these up with opportunity costs of capital or tax distortions"
"International capital flows and interest parity","Capital tends to flow toward countries with higher real interest rates, affecting loanable funds, exchange rates, and AD","Trap: Assuming capital only flows based on GDP size or trade, ignoring interest rate differentials"
